# Polynomial-Solver

This is a linked allocation system to represent and manipulate polynomials.
It uses one of the linked list classes implemented.
Each term of the polynomial will be represented as a node, using itâ€™s coefficient and exponent.
The user have 3 available polynomial variables: A, B and C, that can be set 
and one variable R that acts as an accumulator for the results of operations on other
polynomials. 
A polynomial can have a negative exponent.
